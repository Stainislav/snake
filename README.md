This is the Snake game. For control use a left arrow, right arrow, up arrow and down arrow. You should eat a food - the "$" sign. If you collide with a wall or a tail, you will loose. Every time you eat a food, you earn one point. At the end of a game you may see your final amount of scores. 

I created this program thanks to the "Object-oriented programming" course from the GeekBrains website.
